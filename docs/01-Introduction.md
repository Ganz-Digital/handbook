# The Ganz Digital Handbook

The Ganz Digital handbook describes what we do and how we do it. It describes how we work together and what we work for. What we value highly and what we don't value at all.

## What is this all about?

At the core, it's about one word.

Clarity.

If we were to reduce Ganz Digital to one word, that word would be clarity. At Ganz Digital, we strive for clarity in everything we do. We want to build clear apps, write clear code, communicate clearly, have clear rules.

## Why clarity?

Many companies try to build simple products. Or easy to use products. Both descriptions are related to clarity. What sets clarity apart is that always includes a sender and a recipient.

An app can be easy to use for you but that doesn't mean that it's easy to use for someone else. A piece of code can appear simple to you but can be complicated for someone else. Clarity can only exist with a recipient.

It also has the advantage of allowing for complexity. There are things in life that can't be simple. But even complicated things can be made clear.

Is this clear?
