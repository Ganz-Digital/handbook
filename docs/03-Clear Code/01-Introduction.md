# What is Clear Code?

Writing code is easy. Writing clear code is hard. It is hard, because code has four different recipient groups: Computers, users, fellow coders and yourself.

Making the machine happy is usually the easiest part. You can see immediately if something works or not. The problem with most code is not that it doesn't work but that the person who writes it, stops as soon as the code works.

At Ganz Digital, we want to do better than that. Our code should not only work.

Our code should make computers, users, readers and yourself happy.
