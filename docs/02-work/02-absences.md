# Absences

If you are going to take the day off, advise your manager beforehand and mark the day in your Ganz Digital Google Calendar as absent.

How soon do you have to advise your manager of your absence? At the latest, absences must be advised to the manager according to this formula:

```
Day of Advisory = First Day of Absence - (Number of Days of Absence * 5)
```

So, if you're going to take off one day, tell your manager five days before. If you're going to take off one week (five days), tell your manager 25 days before the first day of the vacation.
