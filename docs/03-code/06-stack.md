# Stack

By always using the same technologies, we improve our efficiency.

## JavaScript all the way

We write everything in JavaScript and TypeScript. Node.js with TypeScript on the server. React, React Native or Next.js on the client.

## Packages

We use the following packages across all our projects:

- [Formik](https://formik.org/) for forms
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for data validation in forms
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) and `react-i18next` for translations
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for date manipulation
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) for helpers
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to catch errors
- [Prettier.js](https://prettier.io/) to format code

## Backend

Our cloud provider is Google, and we use Firebase for our backend.

If not stated differently, the location for our computing resources (database, serverless functions, storage) is Zurich, Switzerland. The identifier in Google Cloud is `europe-west6`.

We write our backend code in TypeScript for the Node.js runtime. It helps us to catch errors before deployment, and enforces us to write code that is understandable for others, too.

## Frontend

### Web

All our web projects use

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/) for UI components like dialogs, menus or switches
- `react-spinners` for loading indicators
- `classnames` to simplify dynamic CSS classes

#### Web Sites

We use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build sites where search engine optimization (SEO) matters. SEO matters for marketing sites, landing pages and company sites.

#### Web Apps

We use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to build apps that run in the browser.

Inside a Create React App, we use the following packages:

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing

### Mobile

We develop our apps with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) in JavaScript.

Inside a React Native app, we use the following packages:

- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for routing
- `react-native-vector-icons` for icons
-
