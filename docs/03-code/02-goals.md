# The Goals of Clear Code

Clear Code has four goals: To make users, readers, computers and yourself happy.

## Make users happy.

If you work at Ganz Digital, you are software developer. Not a coder and not a programmer.

The difference between a developer and a coder or programmer is this: A developer knows that software is built for people. When building software, she thinks about how it will be used. Developers are also designers. Coders are just coders.

You might say: "But I just want to code. I don't care what my app looks like and whether it can be used easily." In that case, dear reader, we are the wrong company for you.

Making users happy starts with a long, hard look at yourself. Reflect upon what makes you happy. Each and every one of us is a user. Dozens of times a day you interact with man-made products.

Let's take the chair you sit on. It was made by someone. It is not a stone that just happens to be there. Why is the chair made how it is made? What problem is it trying to solve? Is it a good chair? Does the chair "work" for you? Feel your body. Do you have good posture? Does the chair allow you to do what you currently try to do? That is, focused reading of a text. Could it be improved?

This is how designers think. Every now and then, they step outside their bodies and think about how they just interacted with a product. What were their expectations of the product? Does the product work how they expected it? If not, why?

You have to think like a designer.

Designers know one fact very well: The human is always right. The product has to adapt. If there is a doubt in how something should be interacted with, there is room for improvement in the design.

Design is not about making something beautiful or even shiny. It's about making something clear.

## Make readers happy.

Readers of code are software developers. Your peers, your managers and even your future selves. Because, let's face it: Once you've deployed that new feature, you will forget about how it's implemented rather sooner than later. Three months after and you have to start at zero â€“ like you didn't write the code yourself.

When we write code, we write it to be read. Much like when reading a text, there are two main constraining factors when reading code: Time and the medium.

The time constraint is simple. Code is never read for the fun of it. It's always read for the information it conveys. The reader then uses this information for fixing a bug or building a new feature. When we search for information, we want it as fast as possible. Therefore, your code should make it as easy as possible to be understood by someone who knows nothing about it. Your code must contain all relevant information but not more.

News are read on mobile phones or newspapers. Novels are read in books or e-readers. Code is read on a screen. At Ganz Digital, we optimize for our code to be read on a 13 inch laptop screen. Since understanding code requires a lot of brainpower, you as a code writer have to make sure that you allow the reader to focus completely on your code. This means: Everything that is needed to understand a piece of code must fit on one screen. Without scrolling.

Of course, this has consequences. The most important consequence is this:

Every piece of code must be self-explanatory.

## Make computers happy.

A happy computer is a computer that doesn't have to work much. This means that your code should be efficient, not only effective. What is the difference? Effective code works. Efficient code works well.

What does that mean exactly? It means that you shouldn't make the computer do work that isn't needed. Here's a few examples:

- Don't define a variable for a whole function if it is only needed in one if-clause of the function.

The computers of today are crazy fast. Even more so the machine that you and I and other developers use. Making the computer happy is therefore the least important part.

But remember: There are users out there with slow devices. Our apps have to work just as well for them. Making the computer happy becomes making the user happy.

## Make yourself happy.

As a software developer, you are a creative person. The greatest satisfaction you get, is probably when the thing you've built works as you intended. It's usually worth more than the paycheck you get. Or, at least, it should be. Making money should not be the reason why you get of bed in the morning. Making things should be.

If you work at Ganz Digital, it's because we see you as a creative person. We hired you for your ability to think, build and communicate. And we want to provide you with an environment that fosters that.

Since we are a remote-first company, we don't provide you with a workplace that we've shaped in a way that makes you creative and productive. It's also something that we couldn't do even if we wanted. People are just too different.

It's part of your job or growth process to find out how and where you can be most productive.

Shut out distractions.
Do one thing and do it well.
Think first, write later, edit last.
