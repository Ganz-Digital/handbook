# Kanban Method

We work with the Kanban method (link). In our Trello boards, we have columns named Triage, To Do, Doing, Review, Done.

Our Kanban board is an overview of a project's status. It must always represent the current status. Keeping it up to date is part of our jobs â€“ everyone's!

## The Triage Column

This is the column for tasks, features and errors which have been acknowledged. It's a backlog. From here, we decide whether to tackle them or not.

## The To Do Column

Tasks in To Do have to be done. They are sorted by priority. This means: The tasks on top need to be done first, the tasks at the bottom last.

Here, people are assigned to certain tasks.

## The Doing Column

When you start working on a task, move it to the Doing column and assign yourself to it (if it's not done already).

## The Review Column

When you're done with your task, move the card to the Review column. It's now time for a review. Unassign yourself from the card and assign your reviewer.

## The Done Column

When the review was passed successfully and new feature deployed, move the card to the Done column and celebrate!
