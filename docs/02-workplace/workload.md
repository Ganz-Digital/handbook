# Workload

## Total Freedom

At Ganz Digital, you can work wherever you want and whenever you want. You don't have to work 9 to 5 or Monday to Friday. You can set your own schedules.

This freedom comes with a hook: We expect you to choose your most productive hours as your work hours. That's our deal: You give this job your most productive hours and in return, your job gives you a ton of freedom.

## Yearly Working Hours

According to the workload stated in your contract, you do however have to work a certain number of hours per year. The number is calculated as follows (for a workload of 100%):

```
52 weeks x 5 days x 8 hours
= 2080 hours per year
- 10 public holidays per year
= 2000 hours per year
- 5 weeks of vacation per year
= 1800 working hours per year
```
