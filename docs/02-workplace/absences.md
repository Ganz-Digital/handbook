# Absences

If you are going to take the day off, advise your manager beforehand and mark the day in your Ganz Digital Google Calendar as absent.

How soon do you have to advise your manager of your absence? At the latest, absences must be advised to the manager according to this formula:

```
Day of Advisory = First Day of Absence - (Number of Days of Absence * 5)
```

So, if you're going to take off one day, tell your manager five days before. If you're going to take off one week (five days), tell your manager 25 days before the first day of the vacation.

## Team Vacation Calendar

You have received an invitation to access the Team Vacation calendar. Please add this calendar.

The Team Vacation calendar is automatically populated by out-of-office events that you add to your personal calendar (the one with your @ganzdigital email).

This means: Whenever you are out of office for some reason, please add an “out of office” event to your personal @ganzdigital calendar. Check this link on how to do this: <https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168>

These out-of-office events will then pop up in Team Vacation. Not immediately, though, as syncing happens once per hour.

For Saturdays and Sundays, you don’t have to add “out of office” events. You also don’t have to add short absences like lunch breaks.

Important: This calendar will be our source of truth for absences like vacation or public holidays. If your absence is not in there we expect you to be working.
